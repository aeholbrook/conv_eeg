A Convolutional Net for Classifying Smokers via EEG

Recent exponential growth in the fields of computational neuroscience and machinelearning have made possible novel means of collaboration between these fields.This notebook outlines such a collaboration – a Convolutional Neural Network was trained on cleaned eyes-closed resting state electroencephalography (EEG) datacollected from 200 light to moderate smokers in the Southern Illinois area to bdetermine from which of two conditions a sample of EEG data originated – eithera participant who had smoked prior to the session or abstained for 24 hours. It wastested on 50 similar participants, to a resultant 94% classification accuracy for thisgroup.
